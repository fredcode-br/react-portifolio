## Comments

This project was developed to expose projects in an easy and intuitive way, in addition to presenting user data and a contact form. The Frontend was developed in react while the backend in php.

In order for the project to be used, you must access the link to the api developed below. If you don't want to use the created api, you must create a repository containing a JSON file where you can include new projects. For this method to work, it is necessary to create a fake api through the website "https://my-json-server.typicode.com". On the site you will find instructions on how to create it, and in the end you will have your fake api that looks like this: "https://my-json-server.typicode.com//your-name/your-repository/". Finally change the project with your generated fake api and add your projects manually in your repository with the JSON file.
